            BAGGU is an e-commerce website, selling reusable, environmentally-friendly bags and other goods. 
            Each bag has a different color or pattern, making them a popular product.
            BAGGU is typically sold online but the company also collaborates with popular fashion brands like Urban Outfitters or 
            Sandy Liang, making them even more sought after.

            <p>This image shows a screenshot from BAGGU's "Pouches & Cases" section. 
            This section is set up with flex boxes, showing two large images of the product to the left (stacked on top of one another), 
            the name of the product as well as a brief description (also stacked on top of one another). The text is large a very legible. 
            The images are also large, allowing the viewer to look at minute details of the product.

            <p>This image is another screenshot from BAGGU's sustainability category. In the drop-down menu labeled "INFO' on the home page,
            one can learn all about the BAGGU company. This screenshot was taken under the "sustainability" selection. It's really cool to 
            know just how sustainable the product is and how the items are sourced/made.

        <p>
            The majority of the website is set up like this. It either shows a picture to the left and words to the right, or vice versa.
            The photography shown on the website is vibrant and detailed. This contrasts with the simplicity of the text and muted background.
            I personally believe it's a great balance.

    <h2>REVIEW</h2>
        <div class="review-paragraph">
            <p>Overall, the BAGGU website is very user-friendly and not over complicated in the design aspect. 
            A muted background and simple font acceptuates the photography of the product, helping it sell. 
            The dropdown menu has lots of options for users to explore from the products being sold to the information behind the ethically sourced materials.
            Ultimately, I think one of the only things I would like to see more of is more JavaScript code. More animation would be successful with 
            this site as it typically is used in modern, successful websites. Everything is stagnant on the BAGGU website which can be read as outdated.
